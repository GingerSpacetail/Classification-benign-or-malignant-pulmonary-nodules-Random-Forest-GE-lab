Classification problem benign or malignant pulmonary nodules on CT images solved with Random Forest and k-fold cross validated
The dataset includes 1297 subjects diagnosed with either benign or malignant pulmonary nodules. Each nodule within the CT images were segmented and quantified with 102 features. The task is to predict whether the nodule is benign or malignant.
Instead of arbitrarily split the data into train and test sets, k-fold cross validation was used so that all the data will be used in training and test set alternatively.
